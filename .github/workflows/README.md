manual.yml is using three preconfigured action secrets

- AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME like in AZURE_APP_SERVICE_NAME.azurewebsites.net
- AZURE_APP_SERVICE_PUBLISH_PROFILE: download the entire publish settings profile and copy-paste its content.
- ENV_FILE_CONTENT, content of .env file to deploy.
  - In secure setup all entries of .env file should be empty, and Environment Variable of Azure App Service should set real values.
  - In this case .env file entries are user to refer to slot names (to avoid autogenerated "undefined" values during next.js build).
